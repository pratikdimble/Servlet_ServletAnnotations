# Servlet_ServletAnnotations
Servlet API 3.0 has introduced a new package called javax.servlet.annotation. It provides annotation types which can be used for annotating a servlet class. If you use annotation, then the deployment descriptor (web.xml) is not required. But you should use tomcat7 or any later version of tomcat.  Annotations can replace equivalent XML configuration in the web deployment descriptor file (web.xml) such as servlet declaration and servlet mapping. Servlet containers will process the annotated classes at deployment time.
